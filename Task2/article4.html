    <p>
        Nature includes everything found in the natural world, like trees, animals, rivers, and mountains. 
        It provides us with fresh air, clean water, and food to survive. 
        Spending time in nature helps people feel calm and relaxed. Protecting nature is important for a healthy planet and future.
        Major Ecosystems

Forests

Tropical (Amazon, Congo Basin), Temperate, Boreal (Taiga)

Rich in biodiversity, store carbon, regulate climate

Oceans

Cover 70% of Earth’s surface

Produce over 50% of Earth’s oxygen via plankton

Home to coral reefs, deep-sea ecosystems, and marine megafauna

Deserts

Dry, extreme environments (Sahara, Atacama, Gobi)

Specialized life adapted to scarce water

Grasslands and Savannas

Home to grazing animals (bison, elephants)

Vital for agriculture and carbon storage

Wetlands

Marshes, swamps, mangroves

Act as natural water filters and flood protection

Mountains

Support unique species, affect weather patterns

Many rivers originate in mountain ranges

Polar Regions (Arctic & Antarctica)

Cold, icy, and fragile ecosystems

Key indicators of climate change

🌦️ Natural Phenomena

Weather – daily changes in temperature, precipitation, wind

Climate – long-term weather patterns (e.g., tropical, arid, temperate)

Volcanoes – release magma from Earth's interior

Earthquakes – caused by movement of tectonic plates

Auroras – solar particles hitting the magnetic field, seen near poles

Seasons – caused by Earth’s tilt as it orbits the sun

🧬 The Role of Nature in Human Life

Health: Clean air, water, food, and medicine come from natural sources.

Culture: Many traditions, religions, and languages are tied to natural surroundings.

Economy: Agriculture, forestry, fishing, and tourism depend on healthy ecosystems.

Mental Wellbeing: Exposure to nature reduces stress and supports cognitive function.

🌱 Environmental Challenges

Deforestation

Pollution (air, water, plastic, etc.)

Climate Change

Loss of biodiversity

Overfishing & habitat destruction

Soil erosion and desertification

🛠️ How We Can Protect Nature

Conservation efforts: Protected areas, wildlife reserves

Sustainable practices: Farming, forestry, fishing

Rewilding: Restoring habitats to their natural state

Individual actions: Reduce waste, plant trees, support eco-friendly policies

Education & awareness
