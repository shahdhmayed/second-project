        Weather describes the condition of the air at a specific time and place.
         It includes factors like temperature, rain, wind, and sunshine.
         Weather can change daily and affects how we dress and travel. 
         Meteorologists study weather to help predict storms and other changes.
         Weather Forecasting

Meteorologists use computer models, satellite data, and atmospheric measurements to predict weather.

Forecasts typically cover:

Nowcasting (next few hours)

Short-term (1–3 days)

Long-term (up to 7–10 days, less reliable)
